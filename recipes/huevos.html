    <h2>Rustic Italian eggs cooked in a spicy arrabiata tomato sauce with a parsley pesto drizzle.</h2>
    <p> A peasant dish easily made for one, two or for a crowd, this rustic meal is ideally served over creamy polenta or with <br>
        Italian bruschetta to mop up all that sauce and creamy yolks. The eggs cook in a rich seasoned tomato sauce laced <br> 
        with Parmesan cheese. Served with ciabatta or polenta, it's a perfect dish for brunch. Make it for breakfast when <br>
        camping, it's quick and easy.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Parmiggiano reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet heat up the olive oil and arrabbiata sauce over medium low flame. Once it starts to simmer <br>
            try making tiny wells in the sauce with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Crack and drop the eggs in each of those wells. Allow them to gently simmer in the sauce until the egg whites <br>
            have set around the yolks, about 5 minutes. If you want the top part to steam a little as well, just cover the <br>
            pan for the last minute of cooking, making sure to keep an eye on it as eggs cook very fast.
        </li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat and season with the sea salt and red pepper flakes to taste. Just before serving drizzle <br>
            theparsley pesto all over the top and sprinkle with the toasted pine nuts and basil.</li>
        <li>Serve with charred pieces of garlic bruschetta or over a bed of creamy polenta.</li>
