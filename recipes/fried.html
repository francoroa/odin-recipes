    <h2>Ultra-crispy fried chicken doused with a cayenne-infused glaze.</h2>
    <p>Nashville Hot Chicken originated at Princeâ€™s Hot Chicken Shack, a Black-owned establishment in Nashville. The fiery <br>
        fried chicken has been popular for over eighty years now. This method of preparation originates within African American <br>
        communities in the Southern United States. A richly pigmented seasoning paste gives the fried chicken its reddish hue. <br>
        Spice blends, preparation methods, and heat intensity vary from recipe to recipe or depending on the chef.</p>
